    "# Part 1: Data Organization\n",
    "Data for this example has already been prepared for you. The data utilized here is from the 2017 MICCAI Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRATS) Challenge. The data consists of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 19 different institutions in subjects with glioblastoma/high grade glioma (GBM/HGG) and low grade glioma (LGG). The different MRI scans include: T1-weighted (t1), post-contrast Gadolinium-enhanced images (t1ce), T2-weighted (t2), and T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (flair). More information on the 2017 BRATS Challenge is available here: https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2017/data.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation for this example is similar to the approach that utilized in the previous example. This includes the use of a Keras image data generator. Your instructor has converted the BRATS data from the NiFTI imaging format (https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/) to portable network graphics (.png) files, which is an image file format that can be read natively in Keras. Each .png file is a 256x256 axial image. In a later exercise, you will load image data directly from DICOM files as a further example. The structure of the data folder is as follows:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  --ImageModalityDetector\n",
    "     --test (17,100 files)\n",
    "           --flair\n",
    "           --t1\n",
    "           --t1ce\n",
    "           --t2\n",
    "     --train (39,900 files)\n",
    "           --flair\n",
    "           --t1\n",
    "           --t1ce\n",
    "           --t2\n",
    "     --validate (17,100 files)\n",
    "           --flair\n",
    "           --t1\n",
    "           --t1ce\n",
    "           --t2\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuring the images in this particular folder structure allows easy use of a Keras ImageDataGenerator to perform the categorization of the different types of data for which we wish to discriminate. Specifically for this example, this includes the type of MRI scan: (flair, t1, t1ce, or t2) of each input image. The BRATS Dataset includes images from 285 subjects, and in this structure the data has been divided into ~66 subjects in the testing set (test), ~153 subjects in the training set (train), and ~66 subjects in the validation set (validate). Thus, each subject contributes 65 slices for each type of MRI scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's work on setting up the ImageDataGenerator to read in our data. Keras has built-in capabilities to perform basic types of data augmentation. That is the ability to apply different, randomized transformations to the input data to increase the diversity of the dataset. In this exercise we will explore the use of an ImageDataGenerator to perform varying types of augmentation. Let's try it out:"

    "### End of Exercise\n",
    "This is the end of this exercise. If you have extra time and would like to try a few advanced ideas, please consider trying the following:\n",
    "1. Modify the code above to include predictions for MobileNet and VGG16. Perform the analysis on the 3 different networks for each slice. Are failure cases similar between networks?\n",
    "2. Try re-training the MobileNet network without augmentation. Do you notice any differences?\n",
    "3. Try adding different types of augmentation, such as left-right and up-down flips. What about adding more extreme degrees of augmentation? Does this improve network performance?\n",
    "4. Try adding augmentation to the evaluation stage to see how the network performs with augmentation.\n",
    "5. Explore the other types of available Callback functions during model fitting. There are many useful predefined types of callbacks that you can use to get more information from your network during training. Read more about them here: https://keras.io/callbacks/"
