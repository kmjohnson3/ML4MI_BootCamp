    "## Answers to Questions\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 1- What could be another use for having multiple input channels?\n",
    "\n",
    "In MRI, multiple sequences are usually acquired. It might take some resampling of the data, but you could use multiple sequences as different channels, for example, T1, T2, and 2-point Dixon images. Including more channels in your inputs almost always results in better performance for a deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2- What techniques or strategies can be used to mitigate issues with overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best solution is to use more data. That is rarely a possible solution in medical imaging, so there are some alternatives.\n",
    "1. Use data augmentation to synthesize extra data\n",
    "2. Reduce the size or complexity of the network\n",
    "3. Introduce regularization. This can include dropout, batch normalization, or L1/L2 regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3- Can you explain the errors made by the deep learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "No! It's really difficult to explain or understand exactly what is going on inside a CNN. There's simply too many parameters involved to be able to pick apart what each one is doing. That's why training always needs validation- it's the only way to check that our model is really learning something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4- How can the validation loss be lower than the training loss?\n",
    "\n",
    "It generally isn't, because the model learns from the training data and not the validation data. Only in contrived scenarios could the model actually perform better on the validation data than training. However, sometimes you will see lower validation loss. The explanations could be:\n",
    "* The model has equivalent performance on training and validation, and slight random differences make the validation loss slightly lower\n",
    "* A quirk of Keras. This is how Keras evaluates losses during training:\n",
    "    1. Calculate loss of each training batch during epoch\n",
    "    2. Average these losses together at end of epoch. This is the epoch's training loss\n",
    "    3. Calculate total validation loss at end of epoch.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If a model learns very quickly (frequent in the first few epochs) then the performance of the model at the end of the epoch, when it evaluates the validation data, will better than the average performance during the entire epoch."
