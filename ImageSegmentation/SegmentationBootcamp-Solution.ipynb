    "## Answers to Questions\n",
    "#### 1- What other choices could we make for input image normalization?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can really normalize any way you want. Some other typical methods are normalizing to the ranges [0,1] or [-1,1]. Since these are CT images we could take advanteage of Hounsfield Units and scale water to be 0, air to be -1, etc. The import thing is that the data is fed into the model in a consistent way.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2- What could be another use for having multiple input channels?\n",
    "\n",
    "In MRI, multiple sequences are usually acquired. It might take some resampling of the data, but you could use multiple sequences as different channels, for example, T1, T2, and 2-point Dixon images. Including more channels in your inputs almost always results in better performance for a deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3- What techniques or strategies can be used to mitigate issues with overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best solution is to use more data. That is rarely a possible solution in medical imaging, so there are some alternatives.\n",
    "1. Use data augmentation to synthesize extra data\n",
    "2. Reduce the size or complexity of the network\n",
    "3. Introduce regularization. This can include dropout, batch normalization, or L1/L2 regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4- Can you explain the errors made by the deep learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "No! It's really difficult to explain or understand exactly what is going on inside a CNN. There's simply too many parameters involved to be able to pick apart what each one is doing. That's why training always needs validation- it's the only way to check that our model is really learning something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5- How can the validation loss be lower than the training loss?\n",
    "\n",
    "It generally isn't, because the model learns from the training data and not the validation data. Only in contrived scenarios could the model actually perform better on the validation data than training. However, sometimes you will see lower validation loss. The explanations could be:\n",
    "* The model has equivalent performance on training and validation, and slight random differences make the validation loss slightly lower\n",
    "* A quirk of Keras. This is how Keras evaluates losses during training:\n",
    "    1. Calculate loss of each training batch during epoch\n",
    "    2. Average these losses together at end of epoch. This is the epoch's training loss\n",
